Task: Create a flowchart and pseudocode for a simple program that checks if a number is even or odd. If the number is even, the program should print "Even number"; otherwise, it should print "Odd number". 

Use the same steps as the examples:

Define the problem: Program needed to determine if a number is even or odd.

Identify Key Processes: # User integer input interface
			# Program prints message declaring if the integer is even or odd

Draw the Flowchart: # (Oval) Program start
	 	    # (Rectangle) Prompt user for integer input
	 	    # (Diamond) 
	 	    # (If Odd) Print "Odd Number"
	 	    # (If Even) Print "Even Number"
		    # (Oval) Program end

Transition to Pseudocode: Start
                          Prompt the user to input a number
			  If the number is divisible by 2 with no leftover numbers
			    Print "Even Number"
			  Otherwise:
			    Print "Odd Number"
			  End
