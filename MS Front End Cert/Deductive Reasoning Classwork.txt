Problem 1
*********************************** 

Write pseudocode to create a program that determines whether a number is positive, negative, or zero. Use deductive reasoning to establish the logical flow of the program.

1. Identify the Premises:
	#If a number is above 0 then it is positive
	#If a number is below 0 then it is negative
	

2. Analyze the Premises:
	# A positive number is above 0
	# A negative number is below 0
	# Zero is neither positive or negative

3. Draw a Conclusion:
	# A number is an integer that can have either a positive or negative value
	# Zero is an integer without a positive or negative value

4. Test the Conclusion:
	# Test the logic by seeing if the integer entered by the user is positive, negative or neither.
	
5. Explanation:

Input: The user is prompted to input an integer.

Conditional Checks: Using the premises: 
	#If an Integer is above or below 0


6. Write the Pseudocode:

	Start
	  Ask user for number
	  If number is greater than 0
	    display to user Positive
	  Otherwise if number is less than 0
	    display to user Negative
	  otherwise display to user Zero
	End

Problem 2
*********************************** 
Write pseudocode to create a program that checks whether a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount. The program should take the person's age as input. If the age is 65 or older, print "Eligible for senior discount"; otherwise, print "Not eligible for senior discount".

1. Identify the Premises:
	#If age is above 65 print "Eligible for senior discount"
	#If age is below 65 print "Not eligible for senior discount"
	

2. Analyze the Premises:
	# An age above 65 is Eligible
	# An age below 65 is not eligible

3. Draw a Conclusion:
	# You are eligible for a senior discount if your age is above 65

4. Test the Conclusion:
	# Test the logic by seeing if the age entered by the user is above or below 65.
5. Explanation:

Input: The user is prompted to input an age.

Conditional Checks: Using the premises: 
	#If the age entered is above or below 65.


6. Write the Pseudocode:
	Start
	Ask user for age input
	If age entered is above 65
	  Display to user "Eligible for senior discount"
	Otherwise if age entered is below 65
 	  Display to user "Not eligible for senior discount"
	End
